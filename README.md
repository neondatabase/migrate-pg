- `--destination <destination>`: The connection string for the destination PostgreSQL database. This is a required option.
  - Example: `--destination "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/destination_db"`

- `--silent`: Suppresses console output if set to `true`. The default value is `false`.

## When Migrating to Neon

- Make sure to enable [autoscaling](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/autoscaling) during the migration process so that the compute is enough for large database instances.
- The following things can result in error during a migration process:
  - `ALTER OWNER` commands
  - `CREATE EVENT TRIGGER` commands
  - Anything that requires superuser that's not included in `neon_superuser` role
